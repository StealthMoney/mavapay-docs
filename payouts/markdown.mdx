# Payouts

Mavapay allows you to send money to bank accounts in supported countries using Bitcoin Lightning Network. We currently support payouts to:

1. [Nigerian Naira (NGN)](/payouts/ngn-payout)
2. [South African Rand (ZAR)](/payouts/zar-payout)

## Overview

The payout process generally involves:

1. Creating a quote for the amount you want to pay out
2. Paying the generated lightning invoice
3. Receiving webhook notifications for payment status

## Currency-Specific Requirements

### Nigerian Naira (NGN)
- Amounts are denominated in Kobo (1 NGN = 100 Kobo)
- Minimum payout amount: 2000 NGN
- Requires bank account validation before payout
- Supports customer internal fees
- [View NGN Payout Documentation](/payouts/ngn-payout)

### South African Rand (ZAR)
- Amounts are denominated in cents (1 ZAR = 100 cents)
- No bank account validation required
- Customer internal fees currently disabled
- [View ZAR Payout Documentation](/payouts/zar-payout)

## Webhook Events

For all payouts, you'll receive two webhook events:

1. `payment.received` - When we receive the lightning payment
2. `payment.sent` - When the money is sent to the recipient's bank account

For detailed webhook implementation, see our [webhook documentation](/webhooks/markdown).

## Testing

Use our staging environment for testing:
```bash

**Note**: All test environment invoices are signet invoices.
