## Error Codes
Mavapay API uses conventional HTTP response codes to indicate the success or failure of an API request. In general, codes in the `2xx` range indicate success, codes in the `4xx` range indicate an error that failed given the information provided (e.g., a required parameter was omitted), and codes in the `5xx` range indicate an error with Mavapay's servers.

### Common Error Codes
Here are some common error codes you might encounter when using the Mavapay API:

- `400 Bad Request`: The request was invalid.
- `401 Unauthorized`: The request was not authorized.
- `403 Forbidden`: The request was forbidden.
- `404 Not Found`: The resource was not found.
- `405 Method Not Allowed`: The request method is not allowed.
- `429 Too Many Requests`: You have exceeded the rate limit.
- `500 Internal Server Error`: An error occurred on the server.

### Error Response
When an error occurs, the API will return an error response in JSON format. The response will contain an error message and a status code. Here is an example of an error response:
