description: 'Set up your account and start building with the Mavapay API.'
---
### Step 1: Create an account
Create a [free Mavapay account](https://app.mavapay.co/register). By default, you will be in the test environment. You can switch to the live environment after completing the KYC verification process.

### Step 2: Get your API keys
After creating an account, you will be able to generate your test API keys from the [dashboard](https://app.mavapay.co/settings). You will need these keys to authenticate your requests to the Mavapay API.
Here's a sample of what your API keys will look like:

```json
{
  "public_key": "pk_test_sddkdkd",
  "secret_key": "sk_test_sddkdkd"
}
```

### Step 3: Start building
You can now start building with the Mavapay API.
In the staging environment, you would be able to:

1. Collect payments using mocked card data
2. Make transfers to dummy accounts (bank accounts and mobile money wallets).
3. Build with our wallets (using mock data).
4. Configure your integration to handle different scenarios like failed payments, successful payments, etc.
5. Complete KYC verification and go live with your integration.
