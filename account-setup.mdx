description: 'Set up your account and start building with the Mavapay API.'

### Step 1: Create an account

Create a [free Mavapay account](/api-reference/endpoint/auth/signup). By default, you should use the test environment until you are done with the integration and are ready to go live.

### Step 2: Get your API keys
After creating an account, you will be able to [generate your test API keys](/api-reference/endpoint/auth/apikey). These keys are a 32 character string. You will need these keys to authenticate your requests to the Mavapay API.
Here's a sample of what your API keys will look like:

```json
{
  "apiKey": "e2a81dcbcc459e3c96c15fe88db653051949058d908"
}
```

### Step 3: Start building
You can now start building with the Mavapay API.
In the staging environment, you would be able to:

1. Collect payments using mocked card data
2. Make transfers to dummy accounts (bank accounts and mobile money wallets).
3. Build with our wallets (using mock data).
4. Configure your integration to handle different scenarios like failed payments, successful payments, etc.
5. Complete KYC verification and go live with your integration.
